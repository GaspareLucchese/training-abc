# Real Estate Odoo Module

## üìå Overview
This repository contains a custom **Odoo 18.0 module** developed during my internship at **ABC S.R.L.** as a training project.  
The module introduces a **real estate management system** inside Odoo, enabling the creation, management, and selling of properties with offers, tags, and property types.

The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with Odoo development, including:
- Creating custom models.
- Defining views and menus.
- Implementing business logic with Python.
- Managing security and access rights.
